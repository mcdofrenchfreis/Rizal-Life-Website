            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> was written during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, a period marked by widespread oppression and corruption.
                Published in 1887, the novel reflects the social, political, and religious injustices faced by Filipinos under Spanish rule. The friars wielded
                immense power, controlling education, governance, and the lives of the people. Jose Rizal sought to expose these abuses and awaken the
                Filipino people's sense of nationalism. The novel became a cornerstone of the Philippine Revolution, inspiring efforts to achieve freedom
                and equality.

                He plans to continue his father's legacy by building a school to educate his fellow countrymen. However, he soon discovers that his father
                was falsely accused of rebellion and died in prison due to the machinations of corrupt friars and officials. Ibarra faces numerous
                obstacles, including betrayal, injustice, and the rigid class structure of colonial society.

                Along the way, Ibarra reconnects with his fiancée, Maria Clara, who becomes a symbol of purity and sacrifice. As tensions rise, Ibarra
                is framed for sedition and forced to flee. The novel ends with unresolved conflicts, symbolizing the ongoing struggle for justice and
                freedom in the Philippines.
