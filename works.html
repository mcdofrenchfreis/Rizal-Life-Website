            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> was written during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, a period marked by widespread oppression and corruption.
                Published in 1887, the novel reflects the social, political, and religious injustices faced by Filipinos under Spanish rule. The friars wielded
                immense power, controlling education, governance, and the lives of the people. Jose Rizal sought to expose these abuses and awaken the
                Filipino people's sense of nationalism. The novel became a cornerstone of the Philippine Revolution, inspiring efforts to achieve freedom
                and equality.

                freedom in the Philippines.
