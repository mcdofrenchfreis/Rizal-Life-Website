            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>
                <em>"El Filibusterismo"</em>, written by José Rizal, is set against the backdrop of the Philippines during the late 19th century, a period marked by significant social and political unrest under Spanish colonial rule. The novel reflects the growing discontent among Filipinos due to oppressive governance, clerical abuses, and the pervasive inequality imposed by the colonial authorities. Rizal penned this work when the Spanish Empire was experiencing a decline, with its colonial grip weakening globally. The liberal revolution in Spain and the opening of the Philippines to international trade introduced new ideas of constitutionalism and self-determination, further fueling the desire for reform and independence among Filipinos.

            <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
            <p>
                Thirteen years after the events of "Noli Me Tangere," Crisóstomo Ibarra returns to the Philippines under the alias Simoun, a wealthy jeweler with a dark agenda. Disillusioned by the failures of peaceful reform, Simoun seeks to incite a violent revolution to overthrow the Spanish regime and rescue his former love, María Clara, from the convent. He uses his influence over the corrupt Captain-General to exacerbate social injustices, hoping to ignite public outrage.

                Simoun's path crosses with Basilio, now a medical student whose mother, Sisa, died thirteen years prior. Initially, Basilio rejects Simoun's revolutionary ideals, focusing instead on his studies and his love for Juli, the daughter of Kabesang Tales. However, after a series of personal tragedies—including Juli's death and his own imprisonment—Basilio becomes disillusioned and joins Simoun's cause.

                Simoun devises a plan to bomb a wedding reception attended by key figures of the colonial government. The plot is foiled when Isagani, Basilio's friend and former lover of the bride, throws the explosive lamp into the river, preventing the massacre. Exposed and hunted by the authorities, Simoun seeks refuge with Father Florentino, to whom he reveals his true identity before taking his own life. In his final moments, Simoun confesses that his resort to violence was misguided. Father Florentino then casts Simoun's treasures into the sea, symbolizing the hope that future efforts for justice will be rooted in righteousness rather than vengeance.
