                Jose Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines. The seventh of eleven children,
                Rizal grew up in a well-to-do family, which enabled him to pursue a quality education. From a young age, Rizal showed exceptional
                intellectual aptitude, excelling in academics, arts, and languages.

                Rizal studied at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree with high honors. He then enrolled
                at the University of Santo Tomas to study medicine but later transferred to the Universidad Central de Madrid in Spain, where
                he completed his degree in Medicine and Philosophy. Rizal also studied ophthalmology in Paris and Heidelberg, becoming a skilled
                eye doctor.

            <p>
                As a writer and reformist, Rizal used his works to expose the abuses and injustices of Spanish colonial rule. His novels
                <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em> became catalysts for the Filipino nationalist movement. Rizal also wrote
                numerous essays, poems, and articles advocating education, human rights, and peaceful reforms.

            <p>
                Despite his peaceful advocacy, Rizal was arrested and executed by firing squad on December 30, 1896. His death galvanized
                the Philippine Revolution, and he remains a symbol of Filipino resistance, intellectual prowess, and patriotism.
