            <h2>Introduction to <em>El Filibusterismo</em></h2>
            <p>
                <em>"El Filibusterismo"</em>, written by José Rizal, is the sequel to his novel "Noli Me Tangere." Published in 1891, it continues the narrative of Crisóstomo Ibarra, who returns to the Philippines under the guise of Simoun, a wealthy jeweler. Unlike the hopeful tone of its predecessor, this novel adopts a darker and more serious atmosphere, reflecting Ibarra's shift from seeking peaceful reforms to advocating for revolutionary change. Through this work, Rizal critiques the social injustices and corruption prevalent under Spanish colonial rule, aiming to inspire his fellow Filipinos to strive for societal transformation.

            <h2>About Jose Rizal</h2>
            <p>
                José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda (1861–1896) was a Filipino nationalist, physician, and writer. Born on June 19, 1861, in Calamba, Philippines, he was the seventh of eleven children in a family of prosperous landowners. Rizal was a polymath, excelling in multiple disciplines and mastering various languages. He pursued medical studies at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila and later at the University of Madrid, where he earned his Licentiate in Medicine. Beyond his medical profession, Rizal was an active member of the Propaganda Movement, advocating for peaceful reforms in the Philippines through his writings. His novels, <em>"Noli Me Tangere"</em> and <em>"El Filibusterismo"</em>, exposed the abuses of the Spanish colonizers and the clergy, fueling the growing nationalist sentiment among Filipinos. Despite his advocacy for non-violent reform, Rizal was arrested, tried for sedition, and executed on December 30, 1896, in Manila. His martyrdom significantly galvanized the Philippine Revolution against Spanish colonial rule.
