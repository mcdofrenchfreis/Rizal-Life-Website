            <p>
                <em>Noli Me Tangere</em>, written by Dr. Jose Rizal, is a seminal novel in Philippine history. First published in 1887, the book
                is a scathing critique of the Spanish colonial rule and the abuses of the clergy and government officials. Through its
                protagonist, Crisostomo Ibarra, and other memorable characters, Rizal illuminates the struggles and aspirations of the Filipino people.
                The novel ignited the Filipino revolutionary spirit, making it a cornerstone in the country's path toward independence.

            <h2>About Jose Rizal</h2>
            <p>
                Dr. Jose Rizal (1861–1896) was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary. Born in Calamba, Laguna, Rizal excelled in academics,
                earning degrees in medicine and philosophy from European universities. He used his intellect and literary talent to expose the injustices
                of Spanish rule in the Philippines, notably through his novels <em>Noli Me Tangere</em> and <em>El Filibusterismo</em>. His peaceful advocacy for reform
                led to his execution in 1896, solidifying his legacy as a national hero.
